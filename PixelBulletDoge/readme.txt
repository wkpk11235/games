replace tada with music you like, add as many waves as you want, though simple rule: 

Meaning of _stuff and stuff:
	_stuff is custom wave, executed in alphabetical order (or stuff)
	stuff is random wave, executed after all _stuff wave.
	
return None, I didn't use it but just return "End" to switch wave.

add all variables to start()
add the code to Update() (every frame)

To add: masks (detection) and custom sprites
